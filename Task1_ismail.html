        Why? -- As much as mankind wields unlimited power, the power of nature can erase our existence at any 
        moment with
         one seismic ripple in the bed of an ocean. Hear the sound of the wind, it is a beautiful representation 
        of life's unchartered and unique bespoke movement.

        sheep probably as insightful and visionary as you can get!  They are the only animals beside humans that show 
        a same sex preference for life! Sheep are social animals and have a flocking instinct.
        Sheep have rectangular pupils "Here's looking at you kid!"

        me it creates a sanctuary away from
        the hustle and bustle the stress and pressure of day to day life. It is almost like being a child taking 
        the hand
        of your mother knowing you are safe and that you are going somewhere peaceful.

        Such natural phenomena as sounds of wind blowing are more popular today than ever. 
        The image expresses serenity clearly. 
        My appreciation for a clean state of mind creates an affinity with this image, how about you?

    <td>This image seems to illustrate the concept that sheep adhere to, which is; "safety in numbers". We often hear
        the expression "Don't be a sheep, be a shepherd". Jesus Christ the most famous and peaceful human spent time with sheep so 
        it could possibly mean these animals can have a positive influence on humans. Is it such a clear choice? 
        For example from the perspective of
         Jesus representing mankind, he faced danger daily as a peaceful individual.
         And humanity or the indivual, also faces threats daily, although humans are predators, 
         we also face dangers daily, just like sheep.
        So sheep or shepherd?????

<h2>Summary</h2>
